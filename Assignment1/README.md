In all attempts at this assignment I failed to work properly handle more than one give call in a single run. demo_return
and demo_any (as well as start) should function correctly.

process_message_system.py is the more complete version of the code.  It contains multithreading which ultimately created
more problems than solutions. Namely, there are a ton of things that don't clean up after themselves.
